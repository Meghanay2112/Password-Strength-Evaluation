# Password-Strength-Evaluation
🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong and evaluate different passwords using an online password strength checker. This helps in learning password security concepts and common attack methods.

🛠 Tool Used

Online Password Strength Checker

🔎 Passwords Tested and Results
Password	Strength Level	Reason
12345	Very Weak	Too short, only numbers, very common
elevate123	Weak	Contains lowercase letters and numbers but predictable
elevate@123	Medium	Includes lowercase letters, numbers, and symbol but still predictable
El3v@t3#2026	Strong	Uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
elevate labs!cloud@2112	Very Strong	Long length, multiple words, symbols, numbers, high complexity
📊 Analysis of Results
1️⃣ Very Weak Password – 12345

Extremely short

Only numeric characters

Common password used by many users

Easily cracked using brute force or dictionary attacks

2️⃣ Weak Password – elevate123

Contains letters and numbers

Predictable pattern (word + numbers)

Can be cracked using dictionary attack

3️⃣ Medium Password – elevate@123

Includes special character (@)

Still predictable because it follows common format

Better than weak password but not fully secure

4️⃣ Strong Password – El3v@t3#2026

Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters

Numbers included

Special characters used

Less predictable

More resistant to brute force attacks

5️⃣ Very Strong Password – elevate labs!cloud@2112

Long passphrase-style password

Multiple words combined

Contains space, symbol, and numbers

Very difficult to crack

High entropy

🔐 What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password should:

Be at least 12–16 characters long

Include uppercase and lowercase letters

Include numbers

Include special characters

Avoid common words or predictable patterns

Not contain personal information

🚨 Common Password Attacks
1️⃣ Brute Force Attack

An attacker tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found. Longer passwords take significantly more time to crack.

2️⃣ Dictionary Attack

An attacker uses a list of common words and leaked passwords to guess the password.

3️⃣ Credential Stuffing

Using leaked usernames and passwords from other websites to gain access.

🔒 Importance of Password Length

Password length increases security exponentially.
A 5-character password can be cracked in seconds, while a 16-character complex password may take years to crack.

🔑 What Are Passphrases?

Passphrases are long combinations of multiple words, for example:

BlueSky!River@2026

They are easier to remember but harder to crack due to their length.

🔐 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring:

Password + OTP

Password + Fingerprint

Password + Authenticator App

Even if the password is compromised, the account remains protected.

💡 Best Practices Learned

Always use long passwords

Avoid common words

Do not reuse passwords

Use password managers

Enable multi-factor authentication

Prefer passphrases over short passwords

✅ Conclusion

This task helped in understanding how password complexity and length directly impact security. Strong passwords significantly reduce the risk of brute force and dictionary attacks. Using best practices like long passphrases and multi-factor authentication enhances overall cybersecurity.
